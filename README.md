I started my machine learning experience by attending online courses and reading technical documents. Then I developed machine learning algorithms and deep learning structures. I have determined the application areas in the company I work with. I apply for learning machine and deep learning structures solutions. Makes me excited to find solutions with machine learning. The happiness of finding successful results provides effective benefits for me and the company.




I agree with that. how we process the data is of importance for the transport performance of the data. However, the actual data is actually distributed data. The quick and easy access to this data means that the output is successful. What is important is the accessibility of the data that is put into use.


Because I don't work very hard with big data environments, I can give an answer as an architect. However, I am working on long time data technologies. Adapting to the issues you specify is an easy and fast process for me. At this point, let me share an opinion.

Nested data structures work elegantly in situations where the children/substructures are always accessed from within a parent document. Object oriented and RDF databases also work well with data structures that are uni-directional, one object is accessed from another, but not vice versa. However, if the data entities may need to be individually accessed and updated or relations are bi-directional, real relations become necessary. For example, if we had a database of employees and employers, we could easily envision scenarios where we would start with an employee and want to find their employer, or start with an employer and find all their employees. It may also be desirable to individually update an employee or employer without having to worry about updating all the related entities.

In some situations, nested structures can eliminate unnecessary bi-directional relations and greatly simplify database design, but there are still critical parts of real applications where relations are essential.

We can use dataframe.
